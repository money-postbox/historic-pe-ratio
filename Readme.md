# ðŸ“Š Price/Earnings analysis for your Watchlist of longterm Investments

This tool provides a clean and insightful web interface to visualize **Price/Earnings ratios (P/E)** of selected companies, helping investors to identify **potentially undervalued stocks**.

The dashboard displays:

- **Trailing P/E**: Price divided by the most recent 12-month earnings.
- **Forward P/E**: Price divided by projected 12-month earnings.
- **Long-Term Average P/E**: Historical valuation benchmark (manually defined, or estimated by the tool (data not available on yahoo finance) ).

With filters for **index** and **sector**, you can quickly screen and compare current valuations against historical averages and identify historically cheap companies for further analysis.

**Data is fetched from Yahoo Finance (via yfinance)**
